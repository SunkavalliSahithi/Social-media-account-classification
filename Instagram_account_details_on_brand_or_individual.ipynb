After that, it sends an HTTP request to retrieve the picture data, and it determines whether the request was successful if the response status code is 200. If successful, the picture is decoded using OpenCV, grayscaled, and then a Haar Cascade classifier is used to recognize faces. {faces_detected} is the number of faces found in the profile photo that has been tallied.
